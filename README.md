# The Tractor Store - Blueprint

## What is The Tractor Store?

The Tractor Store is a template to experiment with micro frontend architecture.
Goal is to create a real world application where developers can experiment with different integration techniques.

The idea is similar to [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) or [Movies](https://tastejs.com/movies/), but with a focus on micro frontends.
